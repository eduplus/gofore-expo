There are a lot of countries, it would be cool to be able to filter them!
We will use TextInput React Native component to achieve this.

1. Add useState variable (input) for the user input (controlled component)
2. Set TextInput value to be our input value
3. Set TextInput onChangeText handler to set changed text to input
4. Before returning JSX, add variable that has filtered countries according to input
5. Change FlatList data to be the filtered countries
